How long it took me:
20 mins: Commenting the x86 code
4 hours: trying to convert the x86 code to y86
30 mins: Writing the y86 code from the C code instead of x86

Additional Comments:
I found trying to convert the x86 code to y86 INREDIBLY diffictult to do without adding
many lines of code and running out of registers. Once i gave up on trying to convert it
and simply writing the function from the C code, it came together almost instantly.
